# CS300AnalysisAndDesign

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For this project we were to create a running program that would do a runtime analysis, load the data, sort the data, create a list for the course, print the courses, and create a menu where a user can input what they want to do.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I decided to to a vector for my project. Vectors have a fast runtime and is better for the process of sorting values. Using a vector also makes it easier to print those values in ascending order. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I did research on how to implement certain aspects in my code. I had some trouble with trying to get the code to work. I kept getting errors. I figured it out after searching for ways to fix it.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I know that psuedocode is very important. It had helped me a lot during this class. I knew what I wanted to do and I knew what had to be done to make sure that everything was done correctly.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I'm now more comfortable writing code. I still have a lot to learn and a lot of information to absorb. I'm now also getting used to writing commets to summurise what the code is doing. I'm also making sure that all my code is organized is easy to read. I also make sure that the code works good.
